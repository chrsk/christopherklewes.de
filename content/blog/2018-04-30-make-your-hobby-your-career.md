Really? Most of us already fell for the cheap trick. It's not that way. If you talk to professional photographers and ask them if they like to take pictures of their friends and families, they often decline. After only a few years they notice that the work keeps the hobby hostage. 

It is counter-intuitive but it will very likely happen eventually.
