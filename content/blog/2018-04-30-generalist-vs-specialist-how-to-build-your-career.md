Building a successful career require you to focus and become a specialist. Do you really have to? Let’s find out.

If you look at your future career path it is obviously hard to find out how to proceed with it. It doesn’t come naturally to decide which parts of your skills you choose to actively develop. Some people tend to just let it happen and others try to plan things out to some extent. I'm one of the latter and find myself and thus thought to write down my thoughts.

Chances are, most people do make the thing they like most the first priority and specialise in it. Which is good. You could say: “Mix your own interests with a good portion of opportunism, luck and effort and you will end up having a great career.“ Easy. We could stop here. But maybe you find yourself being more of an allrounder? A generalist. What now?

There is one thing that bugs me in computer science. IT became such a broad and immersive topic. IT is still eating the world and becomes bigger every day, so are your options and possibilities. Back in the days you had project managers and developers. User interfaces were more like a sloppy task for the common backend developer and operations and sales where the guys you rarely see. Today? There are so many specialised roles, knowledge to be gained and different fields of expertise it became harder to choose. Not only that, all those roles become more connected with each other then ever before and require a vast set of knowledge.

You have to pick the region wisely. There are multiple factors to be taken into account, as it will highly influence if you experience pleasure, joy and financial benefits from it. Factors are market-niche, soft-skills, personal interest, competition and future needs of the business.

### If you want a highly successful career, you have to focus! Yes? Do you really have to? 

It feels like there is a general movement towards more specialism. Offers from FANG or comparable companies tend to be extremely narrowed down in terms of requirements. They look for excellent staff, but most vacancies are for highly specialised roles (e.g. big data developers). Meanwhile, in the Agile Manifesto, on conferences and in articles you'll hear a lot of claims like "Hire generalists and not only specialists! They will be very useful due to their broad experience and your team will benefit from their knowledge and the way they approach problems". 

I absolutely agree with this. You need a good mixture of skills, personalities and knowledge to build an excellent and well performing team. A mixture of specialists and generalists. But to what extent is a generalist useful and is it a wise decision to become one instead on focusing on solving one thing extremely good?

In the last four years I hired a dozen developers and always looked out for type of people. The generalist and the specialist. Does the candidate bring a good amount of perfectionism, broad knowledge in IT, agility and are really into what he does? That's it. You're welcome. You have an highly specialised background in front-end development? You love it? You tend to motivate others and like to talk about it? Sign here. Overall motivation is so much more important than your perfect CV. 

Let's give an example and have a look at my experience of ten years of work in software-engineering. I tried to recognise a pattern and found one after poking around for some time. It’s a barely visible and almost hidden pattern. It’s that I almost touched every topic in IT. I liked most of them, every topic is demanding if you are eager to do an excellent job and this is what I find so exciting about being a generalist. 

I developed Web, Mobile (holistically from mBaaS to frontend), pure backend, frameworks and Cloud Native projects. I worked for a broad kind of businesses ranging from Automotive, Health-Care/Pharmaceuticals, R&D to Retail. My roles oscillated from Full Stack Developer, to Tech-Lead and Architect to Manager. I did trainings, participated in sales & pre-sales and wrote offers for RfQ's. I'm an agile leader for a couple of dozen developers, managed projects, a business unit and have been the Head of Development.  Managing transformations and living up to every role in agile projects (from Scrum-Master to Product Owner) has been part of my duty. I hired people, took care of customers as account manager and managed partners. 

…The list goes on and on. And I don’t want to bore you. Let's summarise: I've been the Swiss-Army-Knife for my companies. But do I know how to scale a multi-million web application with Scala? Hell no, not even close. Should I?

I did many things requiring a wide spectrum of skills and knowledge. Doing this, let me gain a lot of experience from it and let me have a firm grasp of the whole business, ranging from agile leadership to coding zens.

Unfortunately I feel that it doesn't allow generalists to apply easily on most of the offers available, as most of them are very specialised roles or demand an extreme knowledge in a specific domain as said before. But a generalist is so valuable and every team should have one.  If you find yourself here, don’t hang your head. You’re equally important if not more since you’re so flexible and versatile.

### Dear Recruiter, If you don’t seek out for generalist and only focus on the specialist. You’ll miss out and build an unstable team! Diversity is what matters.

I always worked for medium sized businesses where it's very often the case that you will move around quickly. It’s the same for startups. If you're up to it and are willing to develop new skills it is fantastic. It brought me a lot of joy in the past. On the other hand it also tends to be very stressful. Why is that? There is simply so much to learn and especially if you’re a perfectionist – you will never feel like you know enough, this can – if not taken carefully – make you feel miserable. But the good thing is, it is exactly this that  allowed me to built an open-minded personality  which is always keen to push boundaries, expands horizons and values all kind of knowledge.

Sometimes it may leave you demotivated and on the other day it raises a certain uneasiness towards your future career. It brings advantages, but there are also downsides to it. It is a two-sided sword. You are highly versatile, very experienced in fields other (e.g. pure developers) aren't and it gives you a lot of options to choose and benefit from. On the other hand there are a lot of people which always will be tremendously better than you in certain tasks. Being aware of this is a key requirement of generalists. You have to know that there are people better than you and you have not only to accept it. You have to ask them and use them. This is what makes you an outstanding generalist (besides, dear specialist. it's also a good practice for your ;-)).

With a passion for learning, a focus on developing people, and a strong ability to define and communicate a desired vision while being tech-savvy, you possess all of the tools necessary to successfully inspire others and become a valuable player in your company – after you get in and this is whats hard about it. 

It is very demanding to be a generalist. The career path is unclear and it can definitely be troubling if you like to have plan upfront. In my case you could ask: Am I a developer with good leadership skills? A leader with development skills? A very tech-savvy account manager? An architect with a good grasp of business needs? You get the point.

### Generalist or specialist. It doesn’t matter, be bold in what you are and claim that for you. Be the person you’d like to be and a career will be built around you. 

What do you think? Are the big software companies out there looking for generalists? Should they be more open towards this?  I'm curious to hear from you and hoped you enjoyed it. What is your situation? How do you handle it? Do you have any insights or thoughts on the topic?
